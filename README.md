# Homework 8 - Updated Portfolio 

The aim of this assignment was to update our portfolio site with links to our deployed github projects. 

## Composition of Website

I revisted my original website layout, which includes 3 html files, linking to the bootstrap CSS, as well as an additional CSS file. The 3 pages are comprised of the index file with "About Me" information, a "Portfolio" page with whimsical project images and updated button links to each project listed, and a "Contact" page for form submission (that still currently goes nowhere).

## Process

My approach was to make some minor edits to the html and CSS of the website, based on some feedback from the second portfolio assignment. It was much easier to make edits to the website, now that I understand boostrap and layout better. I refrained from making large scale changes to the website layout. Those are still in the works, along with updates and improvements I am planning to make to my linked github projects. 

## Deployment

I updated the files in Github and deploy the website for review.

## Acceptance Criteria

I have added project links to meet the requirements of the assignment. I will continue to update my portfolio website and projects throughout the bootcamp.
