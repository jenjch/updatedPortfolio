# Homework 2 - Boostrap Portfolio Website Deployed on Github

The aim of this assignment was to build a portfolio website using bootstrap to create a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images (with a set of screenshots for reference). Building off the first homework assignment, I wanted to build a clean website that closely matched the screenshots, but with bootstrap elements.

## Composition of Website

The website includes 3 html files, linking to the bootstrap CSS, as well as an additional CSS file. The 3 pages include the index file with "About Me" information, a "Portfolio" page with project images and placeholder buttons to each (currently fake) project, and a "Contact" page for form submission (that currently goes nowhere).

## Process

My approach was to match the design specs from the sample screenshots as best as I could, even if that made the website a bit boring. By first building the index html with bootstrap components (using their documentation to take from features I liked), and then working on the non-bootstrap CSS file, I was able to continue to tweak both the html/bootstrap code and style elements to achieve what I wanted. Once the index page and was mostly done, it was much easier to then copy the html structure for the other pages.

The process included a lot of perusal of the bootstrap documentation and classes, googling of potentially relevant actualized and modified use of the bootstrap code, and trial and error to made the bootstrap layout do what I wanted, especially since it required a bit of fighting/adjusting of the defaults for the bootstrap elements I used. 

Some examples of bootstrap components that I used include:
* Navbar nav with "pills" showing the active page a visitor is on.
* Rows and columns and the grid system for every page.
* Form features for the Contact page.
* Buttons for portolio labels/links, and submit for the contact form.
* Many classes such as ones for fluid images, containers (for the header and nav bar).

Utilizing the built-in responsiveness of bootstrap styles meant I needed to do minimal work to manually adjust for responsiveness and set breakpoints. The responsive design also had visual prompts such as the nav bar changing formats on different sized screens.

I used the additional external CSS to mostly adjust elements like colors to align with the teal, white, and grey theme, as well as to adjust some alignment and formatting built into bootstrap that looked a bit awkward, to maintain good visuals with different sized screens.

## Deployment

Once the website was "complete" (i did a couple of commits as I gradually built out the pages), I then followed steps to update the files in Github and deploy the website for review.

## Acceptance Criteria

I hope that I have included all requested specs. Feedback on whether I followed good practices, and whether parts of my code were redundant or imprecise would be helpful.
